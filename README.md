Mission
tea's core mission is to enhance the sustainability and integrity of the software supply chain by allowing open-source developers to capture the value they create. This is accomplished by providing an ecosystem where code and crypto combine, opening pathways for open-source creators to be rewarded for their hard work and genius. By doing this, tea allows these creators to be adequately rewarded for their contributions, thereby reinforcing the robustness and credibility of the open-source software ecosystem.

Vision
teaâ€™s vision is to create a decentralized marketplace for the open-source ecosystem, making open-source sustainable and secure by aligning incentives with the value contributed by each participant.
